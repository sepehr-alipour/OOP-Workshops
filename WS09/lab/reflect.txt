In this workshop, I learned how I can read files and put them into dynamically allocated memory and then manipulate the content
and write it to another file. By implementing the "read" function I got the content of a file from the inputstream and allocated it to the
m_content variable dynamically. Otherwise, we write manipulated content to the file by using the virtual function that is implemented in the
HtmlText class. 
Also, I figured out how we are able to overload the "[]" operator to access the index of array of content to get the content 
character by character. So we can call it by using "this->operator[](i)" or another way by "(*this)[i]".
Moreover, the rule of three is provided in this workshop that helps me to fully understand how we should implement the copy constructor
and copy assignment operator and the destructor function.
And finally, I had some exercise in inheritance and shadowing the concept of object-oriented programming.
